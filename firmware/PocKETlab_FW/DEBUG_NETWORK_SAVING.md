## Network Saving Issue - Enhanced Debugging Guide

You were absolutely right! The issue is likely that the system can't create the networks file when it doesn't exist. Here's what I've added to debug this:

### Key Issue Identified
When no `/networks.json` file exists, SPIFFS should be able to create it, but something might be preventing file creation.

### New Debug Features Added

1. **Web Form Handler Debugging**:
   ```
   NetMan: _handleBasicConfigure() called
   NetMan: Received SSID: 'YourNetwork'
   NetMan: Received password length: 8
   NetMan: Calling addNetwork()...
   NetMan: addNetwork() returned: true/false
   ```

2. **Enhanced File Creation**:
   - Attempts multiple file creation methods
   - Lists directory contents if file creation fails
   - Uses `SPIFFS.open(path, "w", true)` for forced creation

3. **SPIFFS Write Test**:
   ```
   === SPIFFS Write Test ===
   Wrote 17 bytes to test file
   Read back: Hello SPIFFS Test
   SPIFFS write/read test: PASSED/FAILED
   === End SPIFFS Test ===
   ```

### What to Look For

**At startup, you should now see:**
```
=== SPIFFS Diagnostic Info ===
[... existing info ...]
=== SPIFFS Write Test ===
SPIFFS write/read test: PASSED
=== End SPIFFS Test ===
```

**When submitting the web form:**
```
NetMan: _handleBasicConfigure() called
NetMan: Received SSID: 'YourNetwork'
NetMan: addNetwork() called for SSID: YourNetwork
NetMan: _saveNetworks() called
[... file creation attempts ...]
```

### Possible Issues to Check

1. **Web form not submitting**: If you don't see `_handleBasicConfigure() called`
2. **SPIFFS read-only**: If the write test fails
3. **File path issues**: If file creation fails even with enhanced attempts
4. **Memory issues**: If JSON serialization fails

### Testing Steps

1. **Upload the enhanced firmware**
2. **Check startup logs** for SPIFFS write test results
3. **Try adding a network** and watch for detailed web handler logs
4. **Check if any error messages** appear during file creation attempts

The enhanced debugging will show us exactly where the process fails and help identify the root cause.
